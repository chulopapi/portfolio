      sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the
      changes on our Site. You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. In the event

      changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site. Continued use of our Site following notice of
      such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and
      conditions of such changes. Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of
      your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND
      A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any
      product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be
      resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless
      otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to
      you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
      successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods
      provided under the Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must
      first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or
      dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 55 Main Street, Some Town, CA,
      12345. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.
      If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received,
      either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not
      be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
      party is entitled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established
      alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not
      available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR
      Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the
      Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by
      calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any
      claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
      $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking
      relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
      $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be
      held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
      unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties
      reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
      arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is
      greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the
      Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and
      disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR
      Provider.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the
      arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific
      manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal
      appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded
      within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of
      you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
      cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
      claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy
      or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall
      issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
      award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a
      court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
    </p>

    <p>
      Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE
      A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
      arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient
      and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the
      event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate
      or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead
      electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement
      must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one
      customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or
      user.
    </p>

    <p>
      Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to
      maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
      submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration
      award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or
      unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and
      effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived
      by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this
      Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with
      Company.
    </p>

    <p>
      Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small
      claims court.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a
      state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures
      shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the
      Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other partyâ€™s patent, copyright,
      trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the
      parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands County,
      California, for such purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other
      countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data

      regulations.

      to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer

    </p>

    <p>
      Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our
      failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right
      or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
      effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation". If any provision of these Terms is held to be
      invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or
      unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
      permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an
      agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned,
      subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Companyâ€™s prior written consent, and any
      attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
