Marlon Guandique's Portfolio

The following portfolio will provide the list of the complete projects that I have been deployed as developer.  I am be able to showcase my professional portfolio of my strongest work where I have using web developing tools such as HTML, CSS as well as advanced CSS features such as Flexbox, CSS Grid Layaout, Media Queries and CSS Variables.

```
